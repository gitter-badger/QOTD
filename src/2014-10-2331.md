b"Proverbs 4:20-27\n20. My son, pay attention to what I say; listen closely to my words.\n21. Do not let them out of your sight, keep them within your heart;\n22. for they are life to those who find them and health to a man's \nwhole body.\n23. Above all else, guard your heart, for it is the wellspring of \nlife.\n24. Put away perversity from your mouth; keep corrupt talk far from \nyour lips.\n25. Let your eyes look straight ahead, fix your gaze directly before \nyou.\n26. Make level paths for your feet and take only ways that are firm.\n27. Do not swerve to the right or the left; keep your foot from evil.\n\n[bible] http://iheartquotes.com/fortune/show/11274\n"
