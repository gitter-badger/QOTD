b"Troll sat alone on his seat of stone,\nAnd munched and mumbled a bare old bone;\nFor many a year he had gnawed it near,\nFor meat was hard to come by.\n\tDone by!  Gum by!\nIn a cave in the hills he dwelt alone,\nAnd meat was hard to come by.\n\nUp came Tom with his big boots on.\nSaid he to Troll: &quot;Pray, what is youn?\nFor it looks like the shin o' my nuncle Tim,\nAs should be a-lyin in graveyard.\n\tCaveyard!  Paveyard!\nThis many a year has Tim been gone,\nAnd I thought he were lyin' in graveyard.&quot;\n\n&quot;My lad,&quot; said Troll, &quot;this bone I stole.\nBut what be bones that lie in a hole?\nThy nuncle was dead as a lump o' lead,\nAfore I found his shinbone.\n\tTinbone!  Thinbone!\nHe can spare a share for a poor old troll\nFor he don't need his shinbone.&quot;\n\nSaid Tom: &quot;I don't see why the likes o' thee\nWithout axin' leave should go makin' free\nWith the shank or the shin o' my father's kin;\nSo hand the old bone over!\n\tRover!  Trover!\nThough dead he be, it belongs to he;\nSo hand the old bnone over!&quot;\n\t\t-- J. R. R. Tolkien\n\n[fortune] http://iheartquotes.com/fortune/show/53437\n"
