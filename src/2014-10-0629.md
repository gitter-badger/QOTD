b"&quot;We're not talking about the same thing,&quot; he said. &quot;For you the world is\r\nweird because if you're not bored with it you're at odds with it. For me\r\nthe world is weird because it is stupendous, awesome, mysterious,\r\nunfathomable; my interest has been to convince you that you must accept\r\nresponsibility for being here, in this marvelous world, in this marvelous\r\ndesert, in this marvelous time.  I wanted to convince you that you must\r\nlearn to make every act count, since you are going to be here for only a\r\nshort while, in fact, too short for witnessing all the marvels of it.&quot;\r\n\t\t-- Don Juan\r\n\n[codehappy] http://iheartquotes.com/fortune/show/34737\n"
