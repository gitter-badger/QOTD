b"I used to live in a house by the freeway.  When I went anywhere, I had\r\nto be going 65 MPH by the end of my driveway.\r\n\r\nI replaced the headlights in my car with strobe lights.  Now it looks\r\nlike I'm the only one moving.\r\n\r\nI was pulled over for speeding today.  The officer said, &quot;Don't you know\r\nthe speed limit is 55 miles an hour?&quot;  And I said, &quot;Yes, but I wasn't going\r\nto be out that long.&quot;\r\n\r\nI put a new engine in my car, but didn't take the old one out.  Now\r\nmy car goes 500 miles an hour.\r\n\t\t-- Steven Wright\r\n\n[codehappy] http://iheartquotes.com/fortune/show/27698\n"
