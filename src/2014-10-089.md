Saying nothing, he fired his first shot and, as the duck fell,\nthe dog walked on the surface of the water, retrieved the duck and returned\nit to his master.\n\t&quot;Notice anything?&quot; the owner asked eagerly.\n\t&quot;Yes,&quot; said his friend, &quot;I see that fool dog of yours can't swim.&quot;\n\n[fortune] http://iheartquotes.com/fortune/show/53667\n"
