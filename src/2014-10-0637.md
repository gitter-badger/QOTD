b"Mankind's yearning to engage in sports is older than recorded history,\ndating back to the time millions of years ago, when the first primitive man\npicked up a crude club and a round rock, tossed the rock into the air, and\nwhomped the club into the sloping forehead of the first primitive umpire.\n\nWhat inner force drove this first athlete?  Your guess is as good as\nmine.  Better, probably, because you haven't had four beers.\n\t\t-- Dave Barry, &quot;Sports is a Drag&quot;\n\n[fortune] http://iheartquotes.com/fortune/show/53631\n"
