b"I saw a sign at a gas station. It said 'help wanted'. There was\nanother sign below it that said 'self service'. So I hired\nmyself. Then I made myself the boss. I gave myself a raise. I\npaid myself. Then I quit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t-- Stephen Wright\n\n[stephen_wright] http://iheartquotes.com/fortune/show/1905\n"
