Hey guys,

I've decided to learn Ruby on Rails over at <a href="https://onemonth.com/courses/one-month-rails/">One Month Rails</a>. As I said in my last post; I'm a PHP guy. I've contributed to Wordpress and every website I've ever made I've made entirely in PHP.  However, seeing the increasing number of websites made in Rails, and fearing that PHP will become as useless as Perl (no offense) I realized I need to learn.  

This post is about why I chose to learn let's look at the reasons:

##The Good

* Twitters beautiful, Facebook/Wikipedia not so much
* Easier to use
* Large increase in popularity
* Terminal looks really, really cool
* Superior run times
* Ruby is more like Perl in that TMTOWTDI (There's more than one way to do it)
* More Deployable
* "Better for web startups"

##The Bad

* Ruby is ranked hardest to learn by Udemy, below Python and PHP
* PHP has higher performance compared to Ruby (no web framework)
* PHP has 21% of all programming job postings compared to 3% on ruby

Although I'm being extremely biased, in order to convince myself to shell out the $100 I do think that Ruby is going to be the future of the internet.  The reality is PHP is just old, It's based off C++ and there's no expression.  Although I'm saying this now, I'll see if my opinion changes in 30 days.  Now a lovely infographic that well explains the opinions of some fanboys I know:
