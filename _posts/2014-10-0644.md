b"Doing phone support for a software company, we had a customer that needed an \r\nupdate to our program. We told her that we had placed it in her mailbox, and it \r\nwas there waiting on her to pick it up (our customers had &quot;mailboxes&quot; on our \r\ndial up server). She told us it wasn't there, so we asked her to check again \r\njust to be sure. She said ok, put the phone down, and was gone for about five \r\nminutes. Finally she came back and said, &quot;It's still not there. I knew it \r\nwouldn't because our postman only comes around 11:00am.&quot; She had walked outside \r\nand checked her street mailbox. \r\n\n[codehappy] http://iheartquotes.com/fortune/show/37215\n"
