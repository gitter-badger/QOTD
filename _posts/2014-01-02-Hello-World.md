title: Hello World!
---


Hello, my name is Jake!  I'm a young developer and high school student who's now hosting his blog on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and [Poole](http://getpoole.com).  Although many, of my friends know about my out of school activities on github: I'm going to keep my last name out of the blog for a while.  So hello there!

### Why I chose Poole

I'm a wordpress kid, I've been using wordpress since early 2005, I've used it for literally everything: Social websites, Forums, Wiki's, Blogs, Homepages and even as a base for a node.js search engine I wrote.  I've implemented java plugins and everything else into them, so why switch now?  The versatility that once made wordpress my best friend is now it's worst feature.  I can't count the number of wordpress based sites that have gone haywire because I messed up a single line of code in a plugin; or worse someone else did.  Having to constantly fix errors made me part of a community, but it took me away from the things I wanted to do.  Some other problems I had with wordpress were

##Disadvantages of Wordpress

* Far too backend heavy, I kept going over my cpu allocation
* Third party themes with plugins built-in that shouldn't be
* Standard features doing the job of plugins
* Lack of simplicity

The last reason was probably the biggest, I got so caught up in modifying the code, I never ended up writing, hopefully github blogs can fix that.  I also realize that most of these are indicators of my laziness, and it's true.  I could extremely easily fix all of this myself, but it would take me away from what I wanted to do.

So thanks for visiting my blog!  I am going to try to update it whenever I can however, as old habits die hard I am probably going to end up screwing around with the code adding ever addon I can make for a while.  Also, in case you noticed I wrote this post on the format of the lanyon post, I need it as a reference for this new markup languages, although this is very similiar to wikipedia.

Thanks!
