b"Mind!  I don't mean to say that I know, of my own knowledge, what there is\r\nparticularly dead about a door-nail.  I might have been inclined, myself,\r\nto regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the trade.\r\nBut the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile; and my unhallowed hands\r\nshall not disturb it, or the Country's done for.  You will therefore permit\r\nme to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as dead as a door-nail.\r\n\t\t-- Charles Dickens, &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;\r\n\n[codehappy] http://iheartquotes.com/fortune/show/28383\n"
