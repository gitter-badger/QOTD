b"There's a trick to the Graceful Exit.  It begins with the vision to\nrecognize when a job, a life stage, a relationship is over -- and to let\ngo.  It means leaving what's over without denying its validity or its\npast importance in our lives.  It involves a sense of future, a belief\nthat every exit line is an entry, that we are moving on, rather than out.\nThe trick of retiring well may be the trick of living well.  It's hard to\nrecognize that life isn't a holding action, but a process.  It's hard to\nlearn that we don't leave the best parts of ourselves behind, back in the\ndugout or the office. We own what we learned back there.  The experiences\nand the growth are grafted onto our lives.  And when we exit, we can take\nourselves along -- quite gracefully.\n\t\t-- Ellen Goodman\n\n[fortune] http://iheartquotes.com/fortune/show/44051\n"
