b"The child who refuses to travel in the father's harness, this is the symbol of \nman's most unique capability. &quot;I do not have to be what my father was. I do not \nhave to obey my father's rules or even believe everything he believed. It is my \nstrength as a human that I can make my own choices of what to believe and what \nnot to believe, of what to be and what not to be.&quot;\n\n-Leto Atreides II, The Harq al-Ada Biography\n\n[dune] http://iheartquotes.com/fortune/show/7470\n"
