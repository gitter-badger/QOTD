b"Are you a parent?  Do you sometimes find yourself unsure as to what to\r\nsay in those awkward situations?  Worry no more...\r\n\r\n\tDo as I say, not as I do.\r\n\tDo me a favour and don't tell me about it.  I don't want to know.\r\n\tWhat did you do *this* time?\r\n\tIf it didn't taste bad, it wouldn't be good for you.\r\n\tWhen I was your age...\r\n\tI won't love you if you keep doing that.\r\n\tThink of all the starving children in India.\r\n\tIf there's one thing I hate, it's a liar.\r\n\tI'm going to kill you.\r\n\tWay to go, clumsy.\r\n\tIf you don't like it, you can lump it.\r\n\n[codehappy] http://iheartquotes.com/fortune/show/27814\n"
