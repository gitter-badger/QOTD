b"I'm sure that VMS is completely documented, I just haven't found the\r\nright manual yet.  I've been working my way through the manuals in the document\r\nlibrary and I'm half way through the second cabinet, (3 shelves to go), so I\r\nshould find what I'm looking for by mid May.  I hope I can remember what it\r\nwas by the time I find it.\r\n\tI had this idea for a new horror film, &quot;VMS Manuals from Hell&quot; or maybe\r\n&quot;The Paper Chase : IBM vs. DEC&quot;.  It's based on Hitchcock's &quot;The Birds&quot;, except\r\nthat it's centered around a programmer who is attacked by a swarm of binder\r\npages with an index number and the single line &quot;This page intentionally left\r\nblank.&quot;\r\n\t\t-- Alex Crain\r\n\n[codehappy] http://iheartquotes.com/fortune/show/23431\n"
