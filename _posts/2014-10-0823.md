b'So... so you think you can tell\nHeaven from Hell?\nBlue skies from pain?\t\t\tDid they get you to trade\nCan you tell a green field\t\tYour heroes for ghosts?\nFrom a cold steel rail?\t\t\tHot ashes for trees?\nA smile from a veil?\t\t\tHot air for a cool breeze?\nDo you think you can tell?\t\tCold comfort for change?\n\t\t\t\t\tDid you exchange\n\t\t\t\t\tA walk on part in a war\n\t\t\t\t\tFor the lead role in a cage?\n\t\t-- Pink Floyd, &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;\n\n[fortune] http://iheartquotes.com/fortune/show/53304\n'
