Hey Guys,

	After a one week cruise internet free, I am continuing [One Month Rails](https://onemonth.com/courses/one-month-rails) training course and have some more feedback.  It's gettinga  bit boring in terms of content.  Also Mattan doesn't explain much of ruby, just rails and most of this course is blindly typing.  Anyway, before anything else I would like to show the structure of the one month rails videos
