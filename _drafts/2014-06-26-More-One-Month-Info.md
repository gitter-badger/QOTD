Hey Guys,

After spending several hours and making it through 7 "days" of [One Month Rails](https://onemonth.com/courses/one-month-rails) I have a bit more to blabber about.  Honestly, I'm really starting to like Rails.  I think it's a really good language, and I look forward to learning more about it and eventually to learning Ruby.  So More on what I did in these "days":

##Day 7

Day 7 was extremely easy, all I did was create 2 pages (home and about) and link them to each other.  The pages were home and about, and this was done using the command line (which I found rather interesting) using `rails generate controller pages home about`.  This simple command created two pages, Home and about, of course I still had to route and define both the pages.  This was easy except for the fact that finding the files to edit took about 20 minutes.  In the next video we just used embedded ruby to make a link... Extremely simple.  Additionally in these videos he taught some, but very little html such as `<h1>`. 

##Day 8 and 9 

Day 8 was a simple, 9 minute manner of placing erb (embedded ruby links) in the header of the layouts folder.  Day 9 was a matter of installing bootstrap (sass not less), importing and restarting a server.

##Day 10 and 11

	Due to the fact that most, if not all people reading this are web designers I'll skip the details of day 8, basically using SASS bootstrap we added a default navbar and changed some text, very simple put together in an elegant 17 minute video.  A little long, but one month did an excellent job of explaining css pre-proccesors to new web developers.  Day 11 was simply setting some Sass variables in a bootstrap file.
