  <h1 class="post-title">My first day of rails</h1>
  <span class="post-date">25 Jun 2014</span>
  <p>Hey Guys,</p>

<p>Being an experienced developer, and taking a pretty base level course, I wanted to give some feedback as to how I did in day 1 through day 6 of <a href="https://onemonth.com/courses/one-month-rails">One Month Rails</a> (Even though I&#39;ve only actually been doing Rails for about an hour).  </p>

<h2>Day 1</h2>

<p>So the first day is an intro/overview (totaling 3 minutes) and the much more lengthy installing rails.  Luckily for me, I already  had rails installed, however they did post a great resource called <a href="installrails.com">Install Rails</a> that I genuinely wish I had when I was installing rails.  The website is intuitive and beautifully designed, they finish with a sanity check which details two ways to check your installations</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">ruby -v
rails -v
</code></pre></div>
<p>Fairly simple stuff in case you were wondering, this is what day 1 curriculum looks like:</p>

<p><img src="/Photos/day1.png" alt="Day 1 Videos"></p>

<p>As you can see it&#39;s a fairly nice website presumably built in rails (it would be funny if the website was built in PHP)</p>

<h2>Day 2</h2>

<p>Day 2 was boring me to tears, in day 2 you learn about &quot;the command line&quot;.  After spending several minutes teaching us how to open terminal he proceeds to show us the &#39;pwd&#39;, &#39;ls&#39;, and &#39;cd&#39; commands, all of which I use on a daily basis.  However as with before, were I a complete beginer I would have found his explanation  extremely helpful.  The second and last video was common sense in addition to 100% true.  It was titled: &quot;Debugging&quot; 75% of code is googling.  A 4 minute example of him solving rvm (ruby version manager) errors by going on stack overflow and a Google group, once again quite boring.  It would be nice if some of these sites let you select your skill level to skip some of the basic, generic stuff (kind of like how whenever you learn a new programming language, you have to listen to the lecturer spent half an hour explaining the difference between a &#39;float&#39; and a &#39;double&#39;).  </p>

<h2>Day 3</h2>

<p>Day 3 had one video entitled &quot;Creating a new Application&quot;, it walked through the basics of creating a ruby project with the command line, and accessing the local server, still a little slow for my pace, but more along the lines of what I like in terms of pace.</p>

<h2>Day 4 and Day 5</h2>

<p>I&#39;ve condensed these because it seemed a little redundant talking about them on Github, these two days go over the basics of setting up git on your local computer, I skipped all of these except a cool form asking me for my Github URL.  It&#39;s worth mentioning that for the tutorial one month rails went with terminal over GUI.  This is what I do, but it is a rather strange choice for a &quot;first coding class&quot; website.</p>

<p>Days 2-4 Assignments:

<h2>Day 6</h2>

<p>Finally, I start learning what I signed up for, Rails, in this short two video day, I created a home page, and an about page.  Interestingly enough these pages were suffixed with .html.erb  HTML for what it would be rendered to erb to signify the need for rendering.  I also had to rout all these pages to a specific url, vs just folder placement.  This was definitely a different and new experience.  I&#39;m assuming on build it will build folders according to routing instructions.  </p>

<p>Note: &#39;by Today I mean Day x not today as in June 25th&#39;</p>

<p>Days 5-6 Assignments:</p>

<p><img src="/Photos/day5-6.png" alt="Days 5 through 6 Videos"></p>

<p>A bold look ahead at Day 7 reveals I will be creating dynamic pages.  In a rendered language like Ruby I am wondering how this is done.</p>

<p>Thanks for Reading,</p>

<p>Jake</p>

<p>P.S. Sorry for being a bit above everything, this is just extremely boring</p>
