  <p>Hey Guys,</p>

<p>After a one week cruise internet free, I am continuing <a href="https://onemonth.com/courses/one-month-rails">One Month Rails</a> training course and have some more feedback.  It&#39;s getting a  bit boring in terms of content.  Also Mattan doesn&#39;t explain much of ruby, just rails and most of this course is blindly typing.  Anyway, before anything else I would like to show the structure of the one month rails gets</p>

<h2>Structure</h2>

<p><img border="0" src="/Photos/oms.png" alt="A look inside a video"></p>

<p>The basic structure is a video above embedded using the less than popular Wistia video hosting service.  Under that are tiny snippets of codes with explanations above.  The only problem I have with this approach is it doesn&#39;t make the student type in the code themselves.  As our teachers have pointed out so many times, the best way to remember something is to write it down.  Then again with new users, a missing &#39;;&#39; in the code can cause what would be a great programmer to give up.</p>

<p>Back to the video summaries , today, in about an hour I went from the start of day 12, until the 1st video of day 14.  Not my most productive day, but I was working on other projects before this.  </p>

<h2>Day 12</h2>

<p>Day 12 was extremely boring and repetitive, it consisted of pasting several snippets of code I could&#39;ve written myself in LESS from the Bootsrap website. Obviously not the best use of time, but perhaps a good intro to Bootstrap.  Another odd thing is day 12 totaled, with it&#39;s one video 9 minutes.  A more even distribution of time would be far more attractive.</p>

<h2>Day 13</h2>

<p>The first module in day 13 was entitled &quot;Going online with heroku&quot;.  After my last hackathon, I was extremely weary of heroku.  After building and testing our entire application with mysql, we uploaded it to heroku to discover that their default sql database was postgre and that the mysql database they had provided was bearly adequate to handle a shopping list let alone the large databases our project required.  In any case, I decided to jump back on the Heroku band wagon for the one month rails tutorial, after several minutes of configuring the production file, I was online.  I was a bit shocked at how fast it went, as the people who I had talked to constantly complained about how slow rails initialization was.</p>

<p>The next module, as you can see below was a space where you entered your Heroku app name, nothing special, and probably unnecesary considering the fact that they already had my git repository from earlier.</p>

<p>The Final module of &quot;Day 13&quot;, I skipped as it was about registering a custom domain name which has almost no purpose, especially when your creating a clone of a website that already exsists.  However as I suspected Mattan is earning additional revenue through his &quot;special deal&quot; (an affiliate link)</p>

<h2>Day 14</h2>

<p>Day 14 brought me back to my days of wordpress and plugins.  Instead of writing database interaction to sign up users amongst other things, we used a gem called devise.  Devise adds full functionality of user signups, encryption and other features that I haven&#39;t had the pleasure to explore yet.  Here&#39;s a picture of the courses from day 12 to day 14:</p>

<p><img border="0" src="/Photos/day12-14.png" alt="Days 12-14 of One Month Rails"></p>

<p>It appears that from here until day 18 is basically modifications and further setup for devise, upon looking through the source code I have realized that this is quite a complicated gem, and if I could read ruby, I would be quite interested.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading,</p>

<p>Jake</p>
